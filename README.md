# 📧🔐 AI-Enabled Hybrid Spam Detection System (SMS & Email)

This project is a hybrid AI-based solution developed in Python to detect and prevent cyber theft through spam SMS and email messages. It combines the power of machine learning with rule-based filters to effectively classify messages as **spam** or **ham (not spam)**. This helps in protecting users from phishing, scams, and other social engineering attacks.
